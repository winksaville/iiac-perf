# iiac-perf

Measure performance of various Inter-Intra Application Communication
(IIAC) techniques.

## Design (0.2.0)

Design a Rust app that can measure the cost of various (IIAC) techniques.
By IIAC I mean all communication techniques between and within
applications such as regular function calls vs async function calls vs
channels vs serde/deser of json or zero-copy messaging using io_uring and
potentially any other technique. It would include between threads or
processes or apps on the same computer or between apps on the same LAN or
between apps over a WAN.

Ideally I'd like to be able to see a histogram of the range of times of the
send and receive costs, not just the mean/average of 10^3 or 10^6 invocations.
So the cost of the work should or could be something near-zero such as just
echoing the input, but maybe there is value in doing some constant but
variable amount of work to verify it's in-consequential. One thing I think we
need to be aware of is that if we make the work too simple the compiler could
just keep things in registers which would not be representative of "real" work.

We should start simple, like comparing normal and async function calls and
later expand to other techniques.

## Convention

This is the main repo of a dual-repo convention for using
a bot to help in the development of a coding project. The goal
is that this main repo contains the "what", while the partner
bot repo contains "why" and "how". The key to the convention
is each change is cross-referenced to the other. Thus there
is a coherent story of the development of the project across time.

The beginnings of that tool is [vc-x1](https://github.com/winksaville/vc-x1)
which currently does achieve this goal, but is being used as a
first test bed.

## Cloning

Use [vc-x1](https://github.com/winksaville/vc-x1) to clone
the dual-repo project. It handles `git clone --recursive`,
`jj` init for both repos, and the Claude Code symlink:

```
vc-x1 clone winksaville/iiac-perf
```
