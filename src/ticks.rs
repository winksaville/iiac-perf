//! Hardware tick counter abstraction: thin wrapper over the
//! target architecture's fixed-rate monotonic counter.
//!
//! Probes call three functions; the per-arch impl lives in a
//! child module gated by `#[cfg(target_arch = ...)]`:
//!
//! - [`read_ticks`] — current counter value.
//! - [`ticks_per_ns`] — calibrated conversion ratio.
//! - [`require_ok`] — exit the process if the counter isn't
//!   usable for probe measurements.
//!
//! Only `x86_64` is implemented today. AArch64 (`CNTVCT_EL0`)
//! and RISC-V (`time` CSR) both have architecturally invariant
//! counters by ISA spec, so their `require_ok` will be a no-op
//! once those impls land.
