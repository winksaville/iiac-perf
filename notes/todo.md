# Todo

This file uses [Prose form](../AGENTS.md#prose-form). It
contains near term tasks with a short description and
uses links or reference links for more details.

## In Progress

When a `## Todo` item is picked up, its text moves here: the
problem overview and its list of things to do. That is followed
by the "plan" — a bulleted list of the development "ladder":
   - 0.xx.y-0 blah (done)
   - 0.xx.y-1 blah blah (current)
   - 0.xx.y-2 blah blah blah
   - 0.xx.y close-out and validation

_No cycle currently in progress._

## Todo

Entries are in **strict priority rank** — #1 highest,
descending. Reprioritize by moving an entry, then
`vc-x1 fix-todo --no-dry-run notes/todo.md` to renumber.
The numbers are positional rank, not stable IDs — to refer
to a Todo, name it by its **title** (a greppable mention;
a numbered list item has no anchor to link to), not its
number. Use the
[Prose Form in AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md#prose-form); deeper
detail goes in `notes/chores/chores-NN.md` design
subsections (link via `[N]` ref).

1. Unit scaling in report columns (`us`/`ms`) — per-row
   auto-scale so columns stay eyeball-comparable (bands are
   monotonic, so a row's first/last/mean share a magnitude),
   or `--units ns|auto` for script-stable output; needs
   `--decimals` landed first (`3.18 ms` vs `3 ms`); candidate
   `-4` for the report-options cycle.
2. Investigate: suspend gap missing from samples. A 0.13.5
   `--no-inhibit` suspend test detected ~1.2 s suspended inside
   the measured window but the max sample was only 4.0 ms,
   while the 0.13.1 test (8.4 s gap) showed the expected 10.4 s
   max sample. We think minstant's TSC may halt across some
   suspends and count through others. Repeat the test comparing
   detected gap vs max sample; if the TSC halts, per-sample
   timing silently loses suspend time — document either way.
3. CLAUDE.md governance model (design cogitation) [20]
4. Add framing adjustment to `Probe::report` (subtract
   `Overhead::framing_per_sample_ns` ≈ 11 ns in an `adjusted`
   column, mirroring `harness::print_report`)
5. Convert `harness` / `Bench` to probe-based measurement. Will
   likely need inner-loop support on `Probe` (batch N calls per
   sample; report divides by N and accounts for per-sample
   framing) so very-small workloads can still amortize timer
   overhead the way `run_adaptive` does today.
6. Rename app
7. Design an app to measure IIAC perforanace written in Rust[1]
8. `ice-ps-2t-wait` — iceoryx2 pub/sub with blocking waits via
   `Listener`/`Notifier` events; completes the {transport} ×
   {wait policy} matrix cell that compares against `mpsc-2t`
9. Switch ice benches to the loan-based zero-copy send path
   (`loan_uninit` + `send`) — the API a perf-sensitive user would
   use, and closer to iceoryx2's own benchmark method
10. Payload-size sweep for the round-trip benches (8 B / 8 KiB /
    1 MiB) — makes iceoryx2's size-independent latency vs channel
    copy cost visible in our own tables
11. `crossbeam-1t` / `crossbeam-2t` — `crossbeam-channel` directly
    (compare to mpsc-1t/2t which use crossbeam under the std API)
12. `tokio-mpsc-1t` / `tokio-mpsc-2t` — `tokio::sync::mpsc` round-trip
    inside a Tokio runtime (async overhead)
13. `flume-1t` / `flume-2t` — `flume` MPMC channel
14. Function-call baselines: direct call vs `Box<dyn Trait>` vs
    `async fn` (poll-once) — anchors the channel/serde numbers
    against the cheapest possible "send a value then receive it" path
15. When the second channel impl lands, extract shared message types
    + round-trip helpers into `src/benches/common.rs` (deferred from 0.2.0)
16. Additional thread control (count, per-thread pin lists, NUMA) —
    shape once a concrete bench needs it
17. Rename crate `iiac-perf` → general-purpose name (breaking; deferred)

## Done

Completed tasks are moved from `## Todo` to here, `## Done`, as they are completed
and older `## Done` sections are moved to [done.md](done.md) to keep this file small.
